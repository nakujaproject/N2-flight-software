## Flight Logic 
The flight program is structured as a state machine with the following states: adopted from BPS space 
| State  | Description  | Waiting for event |
|---|---| -----|
| 0  | Pre-Flight Ground    |  20m Above Ground Level  |
| 1  | Powered Flight      |  accelerationZ <=2m/s<sup>2</sup> for 0.1s |
| 2  | Coasting      |  velecity less than zero to detect apogee|
| 3  | Ballistic Descent    |  20m displacement below apogee to deploy parachute  |
| 4  | Chute Descent| < 20m Above Ground|
| 5  | Post-flight Ground    |  No more events  |
