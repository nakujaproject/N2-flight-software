### 1. Folders Description
| Folder  | Description   |
|---|---|
|  include | Contains header files   |
|  lib | Project libraries|
|main | Contains the code for ground station micro-controller   |
|src| Contains main.cpp file the is run by the flight computer   |
|test| Contains unit test files    |

### 2. Files Description
|File   | Description   |
|---|---|
| defs.h  | Contains definitions of global constants |
|functions.h   | Functions declaration and definitions |
| global_variables,h   | Declarations of al global variables used in the program   |
| ground-station.ino    | Contains code that runs on the ground station micro-controller   |
|main.cpp   | Main program uploaded to the avionics computer. It cantains the flight logic in terms of state machines. The corresponding functions are called depending on the current state of the rocket   |


## Flight Logic 
The flight program is structured as a state machine with the following states:
| State  | Description  | Waiting for event |
|---|---| -----|
| 0  | Pre-launch    |  Launch detect  |
| 1  | In flight      |  Apogee |
| 2  | Apogee    |  Pyro output time expiration  |
| 3  | Post apogee    |  Not used  |
| 4  | Drogue (Drogue deployed waiting for main parachute)   | main parachute altitude   |
| 5  | main parachute deployed| Not used  |
| 6  | Post-main (waiting to land) |  Zero velocity |
| 7  | Ground(Flight is over)    |  No more events  |
